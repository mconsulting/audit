00:00:18
Good morning, States Attorney’s office
00:00:20
Hey I want to report organized scheme to defraud, among many other things, and we're talking about more than a billion dollars, and I can prove it.
00:00:31 State Attorney receptionist
OK. One moment
00:00:43 Newlin
Investigations.
00:00:45 mason
Hey I need to.
Well, I'd like to report organized scheme to defraud, securities violations, unlicensed practice of law…
00:00:58 mason
There's a whole lot of stuff that I can report and I can just prove everything.
00:01:04 newlin
So who have you contacted so far?
00:01:09 mason
Well, it depends on the on the time frame I'm reporting to other agencies.
00:01:15 mason
I'm just reporting to y'all also because it's a it's multi state.
00:01:22 newlin
It's multi state?
00:01:23 mason
That is correct.
00:01:26 newlin
OK, well, I said somebody.
00:01:29 newlin
Practicing while multi state and it's.
00:01:31 mason
Well, no, no, no, no.
00:01:32 mason

The unlicensed practice of law is just, you know, that's ancillary to the overall organized scheme to defraud.
00:01:40 mason
It's just I can prove it over
at the SBA.
00:01:44 mason
That they've altered a document also, and it’s unlicensed practice of law.
00:01:48 mason
But that's just one document.
00:01:51 mason
I've got many documents we can prove what I'm saying also.
00:01:57 mason
We can just call the State Board of Administration and there's a couple funds that I'm talking about and they're not going to have a person. They didn't do any due diligence on it.
00:02:10 mason
Either that or they are in the fraud, the people doing the due diligence.
00:02:18 mason
I can prove it.
Over at the FSU Foundation, it's the same two funds that that's they begin with Enervest ENERVEST and Encap ENCAP.
00:02:32 mason
I used to be the CPA for my former employer in San Antonio and I developed software that has you.
We will be able to prove it.
00:02:43 mason
You'll be able to see it when you ask either Carolyn Egan at the Florida State Foundation or -- Uh, well, Nell Bowers is a paralegal, and she was rendering legal opinions and it looks to me like it's a document altered.
00:03:02 mason
And you know, I'm.
00:03:03 mason
I used to do on the CPA or I used to be before.
00:03:08 mason
Well, we'll get into that, but I can prove everything.
00:03:11 mason
I got the source code.
00:03:13 mason
You’ll be able to tell when you ask Carolyn Egan or the general counsel over there at-- the State Board of administration -- when they start to panic on this and can't tell you who did it like, who did the software?
00:03:31 mason
I've got the source code in source code control proving it going backwards and I used to work with these guys I used to be their accountant--So I know the players and that's how I know how to guess Encap and Enervest. And I can show you.
00:03:48 mason
A separate link.
00:03:50 mason
With my emails right back to my former employer.
00:03:54 mason
Who is, I mean these guys just set up.
00:03:57 mason
Different shell companies, that's what it is.
00:03:59 mason
They they just.
00:04:00 mason
It's like an LLC factory is what it is.
00:04:03 mason
They just create a new LLC and hopefully, you know, shield the.
00:04:11 mason
UM.
00:04:12 mason
Shield The investors identities from, you know, people that want to.
00:04:18 mason
Sue them, for example.
00:04:20 mason
OK, that's part a right there.
00:04:23 mason
Part B is.
00:04:26 mason
Y'all gave me.
00:04:26 mason
A trespass or I got a trespass.
00:04:28 mason
Order over at Florida State.
00:04:31 mason
It's the most unusual case of the decade I'm guessing where they arrest a CPA from the Business School.
00:04:39 mason
And take my car.
00:04:40 mason
And since I have the.
00:04:43 mason
Body Cam that they deleted, they deleted their body Cam.
00:04:47 mason
After 500 days, they.
00:04:50 mason
Found out 500 days later that they deleted the body Cam and I'm thinking about selling shares to the alumni because I'm still an alumnus and I don't think that a Cody Poppel trespass order is going to supersede.
00:05:12 mason
I don't I I don't think that the I don't think that the alumni are going to withstand the.
00:05:19 mason
The downward pressure on their credibility Carolyn Egan should be charged.
00:05:25 mason
I mean, that's or I'm sorry.
00:05:29 mason
You see how we have two things and we.
00:05:31 mason
Can both.
00:05:31 mason
We can ask Carolyn Egan.
00:05:34 mason
Do it at one time and it
Will be.
00:05:37 mason
It'll be a hell.
00:05:37 mason
Of a coincidence if.
00:05:39 mason
They can't tell us the name.
00:05:40 mason
Of that developer and.
00:05:43 mason
That I did 53 days in jail over there and been through nine attorneys now I believe and I might be speaking to Jason right now.
00:05:54 mason
The the I.
00:05:56 mason
I was not aware that of the marriage of the judge and the lead investigator.
00:06:03 mason
That would be handling all this police misconduct and stuff like this that we're talking about, like a billion.
Dollars that I'll be able to.
00:06:11 mason
Prove with y'all this morning.
00:06:13 mason
I mean, if you just wanna.
00:06:14 mason
Give a call down there.
00:06:15 mason
Put somebody else on it and.
00:06:17 mason
We'll just continue to talk right here.
00:06:18 mason
They're not.
00:06:19 mason
Going to be able to come up with.
00:06:20 mason
It, But that's going.
00:06:22 mason
To be a.
00:06:22 mason
Hell of a coincidence.
00:06:23 mason
Between that and Caroline Egan, deleting the body Cam and etcetera, they they there's some Brady material that's left out, like those videos.
00:06:35 mason
That I have.
00:06:36 mason
Of the body Cam just showing exactly the opposite of what was stated in the reports.
00:06:42 mason
So we've got some, there's some police misconduct and going on up the line.
00:06:50 mason
I noticed that Peter Collins, the chairman of the board of trustees.
00:06:54 mason
His tenure over there, it closely matches if we.
00:06:59 mason
Put the day that he started at the.
00:07:00 mason
Board of trustees and then find out when he.
00:07:03 mason
Got he took the chairmanship.
00:07:05 mason
It's remarkable the the correlation to my incident over there and you know, I don't know if you know Peter Collins, he's in the
Private equity business.
00:07:16
It's a hell.
00:07:17 mason
Of a coincidence that they sold my program.
00:07:20 mason
Them that's exactly who they sold the program that we can listen here.
00:07:28 mason
We'll we'll take this across state lines right here.
00:07:30 mason
You all can just verify it.
00:07:32 mason
Call long point minerals in Denver, Co and ask.
00:07:36 mason
Them. Who the?
00:07:36 mason
Developer was that did the thing that.
00:07:40 mason
You can see it on a graph.
00:07:41 mason
It's remarkable, but.
00:07:44 mason
I'd like to also know.
00:07:46 mason
Well, I got some.
00:07:47 mason
I got some questions, but I'd like to speak to a real like the supervisor of the Supervisor, attorney.
00:07:52 mason
I want to figure out more about the.
00:07:54 mason
Case history here.
00:07:57 mason
But see, I got two things right there, OK, that's that's both of them right there.
00:08:02 mason
In a nutshell.
00:08:07 mason
Whoever that I talked to you for that stuff.
00:08:12 mason
Ohh there's.
00:08:14 newlin
The guy named Tom Gam.
00:08:16 mason
What's his? What's his position?
00:08:19
Supervisor over at county court, which would be the case that you're talking about.
00:08:23 mason
Supervisor over county like he's like, Grant Slayton.
00:08:28 mason
Is that?
00:08:28 newlin
Now he's over the he's over misdemeanor court, if that's.
00:08:33 newlin
If you're wanting to talk to somebody, that's prostate dealing.
00:08:35 newlin
With prosecution or case, that's who you.
00:08:37
Talk to.
00:08:38 newlin
If you're wanting somebody to.
00:08:39 newlin
Investigate the case. You need to call another agency that would be FDL EFB.
00:08:43 mason
Oh yeah.
00:08:44 mason
Yeah, I do have a.
00:08:46 mason
I got a thing over there already.
00:08:48 mason
Really, they're hiding out from me.
00:08:51 mason
Nick Rat is hiding from me for has been for 60 days.
00:08:55 mason
Like they're not doing well over there.
00:08:57 mason
I don't think the office of.
00:09:00 mason
It's it's a hell of a thing when you know, when I when you run in a, you know, a forensic accountant.
00:09:07 mason
Like I can figure stuff out and I've figured stuff out and.
00:09:12 mason
So ohh, let me.
00:09:14 mason
Let me also just throw in.
00:09:17 mason
That I have a strong arm robbery on audio and what they're trying to do, it's.
00:09:24 mason
They're trying to get my phone out of my hand cause I.
00:09:26 mason
Just nailed them and the.
00:09:28 mason
Thing we were talking about was the fixed operation over there at Florida State.
00:09:33 mason
So there's a strong armed.
00:09:35 mason
Robbery that also needs to be reported and.
00:09:38 mason
I think that.
00:09:38 mason
Might fall under some Brady material also, since it's the same person that.
00:09:44 mason
That lined up the whole thing.
00:09:47 mason
See, they leave out that.
00:09:48 mason
They took.
00:09:49 mason
My car from me and wouldn't look at the title.
00:09:53 mason
That's some Brady material when they wouldn't look at my title and took my car away right from, you know, and you can't just, you know, when you're right there at the Call Street garage, you can't really, you know, and you live 100 miles from from there when they take your car. That's a hell of a thing. And that whole thing got missed.
00:10:14 mason
On the Brady material, Karla Kraft, AKA Carla Weber.
00:10:21 mason
Well, I'd like to find out like.
00:10:22 mason
I can't find her marriage record.
00:10:25 mason
But anyway, there's a similar.
00:10:26 mason
Thing going on over.
00:10:27 mason
There in Bay County, where Chelsea Seaton Stewart, it's a simple.
00:10:32 mason
Very similar like the prosecutor that gets set up with me, it's a girl and her name changes like.
00:10:39 mason
And without just like an Immaculate Conception, you know?
00:10:43 mason
Like without a Husband, I mean, that seems to be a pattern. But anyway I want to get a civil rights lawyer and I'm just kind of getting y'all's position and letting y'all know some stuff that didn't make it into that report.
00:10:59 mason
And I, you know, I know more about the duties of a prosecutor and I'm not thinking that this is going to be the slam dunk.
00:11:05 mason
That Angela Senich told me that it was Angela Senich also.
00:11:10 mason
Well, we're going to.
00:11:12 mason
She's intimately involved in this.
00:11:16 mason
I think I can prove that I got my I, you know, I retained all the emails that I've had throughout the nine attorneys that and been.
00:11:25 mason
Buck is my current attorney, it says on the website.
But you know, he had a problem over there in Jacksonville.
Where he abandoned all his clients and the bar was on top of him.
00:11:37 mason
So I'm wondering why he's still on my.
00:11:41 mason
You know my 6th and I still haven't been able to get my side across apparently.
00:11:47 mason
And you know, we're just kicking the can down the road.
00:11:50 mason
And I'm thinking you.
00:11:52 mason
Know all all the.
00:11:53 mason
Florida State has to do is is, you know, it's a trespassing case at my alma mater, that doesn't make it into the report.
00:12:01 mason
But you know, if they don't want.
00:12:02 mason
To prosecute it, then the case goes.
00:12:04 mason
Away it would seem, and I I think I can push enough.
00:12:09 mason
You know, particularly with the presidential campaign.
00:12:12 mason
That I can raise enough awareness that I can get some some legal defense flowing in from around the country and the Florida State alumni.
00:12:25 mason
I I think that.
00:12:26 mason
There's going to be some alumni that want this to not get out as far as I intend to push it.
00:12:34 mason
You know, I didn't give up.
00:12:35 mason
I didn't check my First Amendment rights when Cody Poppell gave me something that should land him in the cooler for official misconduct, along with his supervisor and a few others up there.
00:12:51 mason
Anyway, so I don't know if y'all want to update y'all's file or whatever, but I've got enough explosive stuff that I don't think that the. I don't think that the alumni and the.
You know the Business School of which I'm going to, I don't think that they're going to be able to withstand the public.
00:13:11 mason
When I go down the Facebook post and say.
00:13:14 mason
OK.
00:13:15 mason
You know, I see what they're saying there.
00:13:17 mason
And then I compare it to me and I'm a hell of an example, you know, especially when y'all don't come up with the name of the when they don't come up with the name of the developer that's going to not look good for the recruiting over at FSU.
00:13:34 mason
OK. And so?
00:13:38 mason
Is there a lawyer that we can identify?
00:13:42 mason
If it's, what is it, unlicensed practice of law and you know the lawyer?
00:13:50 mason
The good thing about having a lawyer is that they have they have to worry about their bar license.
00:13:56 mason
You know, they can't just spout off.
00:13:58 mason
And stop at me and hope you know, just not worry about it.
00:14:02 mason
And that's why Nell Bowers, they put a paralegal out there to handle the billion dollars that I was asking about.
00:14:10 mason
Because you can lose your law license and then some.
00:14:15 mason
So I'd like to speak to whoever the supervisor attorney is over there.
00:14:22 newlin
So again, what are you wanting to ask them?
00:14:25 mason
I I would not.
00:14:27 mason
I'm I'd rather not.
00:14:29 mason
Have the layer the intermediate.
00:14:31 mason
I'd like to get his.
00:14:33 mason
You know, his like an interview.
00:14:35 mason
Like a.
00:14:39 mason
You can't do that.
00:14:40 mason
Was that why? I'm sorry.
00:14:44 newlin
Our office is currently prosecuting you.
00:14:46 mason
Yes, yes.
00:14:49 newlin
So we should not be having a conversation.
00:14:51 mason
Ohh well I don't have a lawyer.
00:14:54 newlin
So you're gonna.
00:14:55 newlin
You're gonna do that Pro se?
00:14:56 mason
No, no, no.
00:14:57 mason
I'm I'm reaching out across the country with what you all are saying and I'm going to solicit a lawyer out there and also simultaneously push it out to the FSU alumni and see if I can get some legal defense.
00:15:11 mason
And you know, maybe.
00:15:13 mason
Especially if we can't, you know, because as soon as I call you as soon as we hang up, then I'm falling over at the pension fund and that'll be a big day.
00:15:22 mason
You know, when I when I can show that there's a billion dollars.
Riding on this and just going to make Cody Poppell’s trespass order look small by comparison.
00:15:37 mason
Oh yes.
00:15:39 newlin
You can do it.
00:15:40
If you want.
00:15:40
To communicate with you.
00:15:42 newlin
You can do it.
00:15:42 newlin
Via e-mail.
00:15:43
I don't have.
00:15:43 mason
Attorney there's no attorney.
00:15:46 newlin
Now I'm talking about the prosecuting attorney.
00:15:48 mason
OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let.
00:15:49 mason
Me get his name?
00:15:51 mason
What is your name?
00:15:52 mason
My name is Lance Mason.
00:16:00 mason
Yes, that's that's.
00:16:01 mason
What I want I want to see like who made the decision to go forward on this also, yes.
00:16:13 newlin
There's nobody.
00:16:16 mason
So there's just no mechanism to override that.
00:16:22 mason
OK.
00:16:23 mason
What's your name?
00:16:24 mason
What's your badge number?
00:16:28 mason
The one you thought you.
00:16:28
Were talking to.
00:16:29 mason
Jason Newman.
00:16:32 mason
No kidding.
00:16:33 mason
Hey, you, you you're a good.
00:16:34 mason
Looking guy, I saw you test, I mean, that's what the girls are like.
00:16:38 mason
I'm looking at you testifying there.
00:16:39 mason
And he's a he's a good looking.
00:16:41 mason
Guy, but you you do.
00:16:43 mason
Bear a resemblance to Brad Paisley if you've ever been.
00:16:46 mason
Told that I don't know.
00:16:48 mason
But that.
00:16:49
Was the new one.
00:16:50
Over there.
00:16:51 mason
But you know not.
00:16:52 mason
With the beard.
00:16:53 mason
But you're a good looking.
00:16:54 mason
Guy for sure.
00:16:56 newlin
So just pending and it's not currently assigned to anybody.
00:17:00 newlin
That's kind of where this.
00:17:01
That's what's going on here.
00:17:02
I don't have.
00:17:03 newlin
Anybody attended to you can.
00:17:05 newlin
File a motion through the court
And that that communication can.
00:17:10 newlin
Get to the judge.
00:17:11
Right.
00:17:16
Right.
00:17:17 mason
So even if you all have actual knowledge of so.
00:17:25 mason
Hey, OK, that's cool the.
00:17:27 mason
Let me ask about the status of Ben Buck--like do I have a current attorney or no?
00:17:36 newlin
No, they don't.
00:17:37 newlin
Well, it does say.
00:17:40 mason
Yeah, it says also says he's active.
So are you currently in Tallahassee?
00:17:51 mason
No, I'm in San Antonio.
00:17:53 mason
Like I've been trying to like uh.
00:17:57 mason
That there's been seven attorneys so far, and none has done anything and.
00:18:03 mason
None has even.
00:18:06 mason
Push my side over there.
00:18:08 mason
You know my story or whatever, Angela sink.
00:18:13 mason
Well, she should. She should.
00:18:15 mason
Be looking at being disbarred.
00:18:16 mason
At a minimum, there's a stalking is there?
00:18:20 mason
Is there a she?
00:18:23 mason
You know?
00:18:23 mason
She withdrew as as my counsel and.
00:18:28 mason
Filed something for stalking the same day.
00:18:31 mason
And this is no.
00:18:33 mason
You know it's going to be.
00:18:34 mason
A hell of.
00:18:34 mason
A thing if if I show that there's a billion dollars gone and that.
00:18:38
If that's a hell of.
00:18:39 mason
A conflict of interest right there for.
00:18:42 mason
Peter Bond and then to be pushing a A trespassing.
00:18:48 mason
You know, when they when they themselves won't be able to answer the billion dollar question.
00:18:53 mason
I think the the tables are going to turn.
00:18:57 mason
And is it not true that if should the Florida State, the higher ups, the successor of--what's her name?
00:19:07 mason
Carolyn Egan, because I don't think she's going to withstand it.
00:19:10 mason
I think she's going to be driven from office.
00:19:13 mason
But whoever, once they say that.
OK, we drop the trespass.
00:19:18 mason
It goes away, correct?
00:19:21
Once they say they dropped the trespass  back, yeah.
00:19:25 newlin
Yeah, that's that's.
Kind of up for debate, OK.
00:19:29
Well, check this out.
00:19:29 mason
Then I will be I will.
00:19:31 mason
File charges for the.
00:19:33 mason
Theft of my vehicle and the obstruction of justice.
00:19:36 mason
Or I'm sorry the the the official misconduct that is going.
00:19:41 mason
To be her.
00:19:42 mason
When she deleted.
00:19:43 mason
The bodycam and won't give me the bodycam audit logs, I will press charges for that and.
It's going to be a shitstorm over there at you know in the media. It's got that potential for sure.
00:19:59 mason
You know, if y'all want to charge me with trespassing, I'm going to press forward with the.
00:20:06 mason
With what I was just talking.
00:20:07 mason
About and those are.
00:20:08 mason
Felonies and we'll see.
00:20:09 mason
How hard that?
00:20:10 mason
They want to defend.
00:20:13 mason
When we look.
00:20:15 mason
Also, and the billion dollars that I'm talking about, we'll see what the public you know considers if they consider that there might be the appearance of impropriety.
00:20:28 mason
Like, OK, I'll handle that.
00:20:32 mason
I'll take the trespass.
00:20:35 mason
We'll see if they want to keep it up.
00:20:38 mason
And I will, I will.
00:20:41 mason
File the charges against her and it's I.
Mean it's, it's.
Just sitting.
00:20:45 mason
She's a she's a sitting duck because she I allow the body Cam to to be deleted.
00:20:50 mason
I mean, that's not in debate and she won't let me see.
00:20:53 mason
The audit logs, which would reveal everything, and she has they sent Angela Senich out there on a suicide mission
Well, they I think they thought that they would roll me, but I'm not.   I feel like I'm on Terra Firma with my university, I feel like that I'll be able to get some support from some alumni out there, you know.
00:21:22 mason
So OK, let's see.
00:21:26 mason
Do anything.
00:21:28 mason
Don't want to hear about any any braiding material that that you know there's a strong arm robbery on the audio.
00:21:35 mason
Would y'all like to for me to push that over there so y'all can listen to it and?
00:21:39 mason
See if it sounds like.
00:21:40 mason
It to you, we're talking about the.
00:21:42 mason
Case right here.
00:21:43 mason
I mean we're.
00:21:43 mason
Talking about the same case.
00:21:49
All right.
00:21:50
What are we trying to get to you with?
00:21:52
Our office because.
00:21:52 newlin
I told you you're not going to talk to the.
00:21:54
Prosecutor because we don't.
00:21:55

00:21:55 newlin

00:22:09 mason
Like who?
00:22:10 mason
I'd I'd like to know.
00:22:12 mason
Carla craft came on right there.
00:22:14 mason
I noticed, you know, with the she was Carla Webber.
00:22:18 mason
UMI noticed that Jack Campbell.
00:22:23 mason
I was looking on the.
00:22:24 mason
Website of Gwen Campbell and.
00:22:27 mason
What was it he?
00:22:28 mason
It's like she got a temporary authorization or something to be, you know, to be his designee.
00:22:35 mason
It it it looked like that cause I looked up other prosecutors and they hadn't done that.
00:22:39 mason
So she was the was she the one that made the initial assessment that that, that we had met the standard.
00:22:47 mason
Like I wanna I.
00:22:48 mason
That's very interesting to me is how.
00:22:51 mason
Did we arrive there?
00:22:55 newlin
Again, I'm not gonna speak for a prosecutor.
00:22:58
I can only.
00:22:58 mason
No, but that's that's like an that's an HR.
00:23:01 mason
Thing, I mean, that's.
00:23:02 mason
Like the org chart.
00:23:04 newlin
Yeah, but she's no longer here.
00:23:05 newlin
So I'm.
00:23:05 newlin
Not gonna speak on what she did.
00:23:08 mason
Right.
00:23:09 newlin

00:23:10
Tell you to do.
00:23:10

00:23:11
Want to communicate with our.
Office. I would do it In writing.
00:23:13 newlin

Here, and have a oral conversation.
00:23:24 newlin
With somebody and you're not in the county.
00:23:28 newlin
Your case is pending.
00:23:30 newlin
I don't think you need to.
00:23:31 newlin
Be having communication over the phone.

This would.
00:23:33 newlin
Have to be your in person or in writing.

00:23:41 mason
That's fine. OK. I mean.
